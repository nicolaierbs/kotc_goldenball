# King of the Court - How to use the golden ball?


As a big beach volleyball fan, I enjoy watching the [King of the Court](https://www.kingofthecourt.com) events.
In these event the winner of the group phase receives a 'golden ball'.
The purpose of the golden ball is to be allowed to repeat a rallye in a later session.
This could be a huge advantage as the team can continue a sideout streak.
The only question is when to use the golden ball.

## Golden ball strategies
As one king of the court session contains many rallies, there is a huge number of situations in which the golden ball can be used.
The players do not have any option to calculate the situation on the fly and no coaches are allowed.
Hence, I recommend to stick to a single strategy which is easy to apply:
* Do not use it: Just for comparison or for those teams without the need for any advantage.
* Use it as early as possible: Baseline strategy without the need to think any further about it.
* Use it only in the last 30 seconds: In the last 30 seconds service errors count as points which is good on the queen/king side and leads to easier serves. However, it does not happen to often that you are on this side at the very end.
* Use it only in the last six minutes and only if the serving team is in last or second to last position: This strategy let you wait until it is more evident who might be your direct opponent for elimination and makes it harder for them to get to the queen/king side.
* Use it only in the last two minutes and only if the serving team is in last or second to last position: Like before but focused on the crunch time.
* Usi it only in the last two minutes and only if the serving team is in first or second position: Similar to the other but directed towards winning the session (in case of just three teams).
